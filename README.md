## Installation Instructions ##

PREREQUISITES: 
               Please have `git` installed, and have a working github account, [preferably with SSH access](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/). 
               Please also make sure that you have npm installed, too. The best way to install it for personal use is [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#verify-installation).
